# Architecture

routatic-proxy sits between Claude Code and upstream model providers, intercepting Anthropic API requests and routing them to the optimal model. The design prioritizes cost efficiency, reliability, and zero-config operation.

## Core Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `internal/handlers` | HTTP request handling, message parsing, orchestration |
| `internal/router` | Scenario detection, model selection, fallback chains |
| `internal/transformer` | Anthropic ↔ OpenAI/Responses/Gemini format conversion |
| `internal/client` | Upstream HTTP client, provider detection utilities |
| `internal/config` | JSON config loading, hot reload, atomic access |
| `internal/models` | Model classification utilities (endpoint type detection) |
| `internal/provider` | Provider-based dispatch (new path, replaces legacy client) |
| `internal/token` | Token counting via tiktoken |
| `internal/daemon` | Background mode, PID management, autostart |

## Scenario-Based Routing

The router analyzes each request and assigns it a scenario. Each scenario maps to a primary model and a fallback chain, all config-driven.

**Detection priority** (highest to lowest):

1. **Long Context** — token count exceeds `context_threshold` (default 100K) → MiniMax (1M context)
2. **Vision** — request contains images → vision-capable model
3. **Complex** — architectural patterns, tool operations → GLM-5.1
4. **Think** — reasoning keywords in system prompt → GLM-5
5. **Background** — simple read-only ops, no tools → Qwen3.5 Plus
6. **Default** → Kimi K2.6

**Streaming override**: when `enable_streaming_scenario_routing` is false (default), streaming requests always route to the `fast` model (Qwen3.6 Plus) for better TTFT.

## Request Transformation

Claude Code sends Anthropic Messages API format. The proxy transforms to the provider's native format:

| Provider | Format | Endpoint |
|----------|--------|----------|
| OpenCode Go (most models) | OpenAI Chat Completions | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| OpenCode Go (MiniMax, Qwen) | Anthropic Messages | `/v1/messages` |
| OpenCode Zen (Claude, Qwen) | Anthropic Messages | `/v1/messages` |
| OpenCode Zen (GPT models) | OpenAI Responses | `/v1/responses` |
| OpenCode Zen (Gemini) | Gemini | `/v1/models/{id}` |

**Endpoint classification** is handled by `internal/models.ClassifyEndpoint()`, which is shared between the client and provider packages to ensure consistent routing.

**Key transformation details:**

- Anthropic `tool_use` ↔ OpenAI `function_calling` bidirectional translation
- Anthropic `thinking` blocks ↔ OpenAI `reasoning_content` preservation
- DeepSeek system message rewriting to prevent prefix cache invalidation
- Image blocks: base64 data URL for vision models, `[Image]` placeholder for non-vision
- `cache_control` stripping for non-DeepSeek models

## Fallback & Circuit Breaker

When a model fails, the proxy tries the next model in the chain. The circuit breaker prevents repeated calls to failing models:

```
Closed (normal) → 3 failures → Open (skip) → 30s timeout → Half-Open (test) → success → Closed
                                                                            → failure → Open
```

- Only 5xx errors and network failures trigger the circuit breaker
- 4xx errors (bad request, rate limit) skip the breaker — retrying won't help
- Per-model tracking: each model has its own circuit breaker

## Streaming Architecture

Streaming uses a per-byte idle watchdog instead of a server-level write timeout:

1. Server `WriteTimeout` is 0 (disabled) — long SSE streams must not be killed mid-flight
2. Each upstream read uses `http.ResponseController.SetReadDeadline` that resets on every successful byte
3. If no byte arrives within `stream_timeout_ms`, the connection is treated as stuck
4. Heartbeat comments (`:keepalive\n\n`) are sent every 3s to keep the connection alive
5. Client disconnects during stream are logged at Debug level — normal during tool execution

## Configuration Hot Reload

When `hot_reload: true`, a filesystem watcher monitors the config file. Changes are applied atomically via `AtomicConfig` — all readers see a consistent snapshot without locks. The HTTP server, model router, and provider registry all read from the same atomic pointer.

## Polymorphic Field Handling

Anthropic's `system` and `content` fields accept both strings and arrays. The `pkg/types` package uses `json.RawMessage` with accessor methods (`SystemText()`, `ContentBlocks()`) to handle both formats transparently.

## Design Decisions

**Why config-driven routing?** Adding a new model requires zero code changes — just add an entry to `config.json`. The scenario detector, fallback chains, and model metadata are all declarative.

**Why not use Anthropic format everywhere?** Most upstream models only support OpenAI Chat Completions format. The proxy handles the translation so Claude Code doesn't need to know which provider it's talking to. Bedrock Mantle models also use Chat Completions format via the `aws-bedrock` provider.

**Why per-read idle timeout instead of WriteTimeout?** Claude Code's tool execution can pause streams for minutes. A server-level timeout would kill active streams. The per-byte watchdog only triggers when the upstream is truly stuck.

**Why rewrite DeepSeek system messages?** DeepSeek internally reorders all system-role messages to the front. Claude Code injects system reminders mid-conversation, which would shift the message history and invalidate the prefix cache. Wrapping them in `<system-reminder>` tags prevents reordering.
